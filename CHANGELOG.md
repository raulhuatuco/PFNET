* Fixed indentation bug in problem.show().
* (Conservative) linearized AC thermal limits via external and optional "line_flow" library.
* Changed key "raw parser" to "raw_parser" in "info" dictionary of pfnet python wrapper, and added "line_flow".

* Fixed sign error with second derivative of current mag with respect to phase shift in AC_FLOW_LIM constraints.

Version 1.2.9
-------------
* Changed function Hessian nnz counter (Hcounter to Hphi_nnz).
* Problem add_function takes Function object/struct and not function name.
* Problem add_constraint takes Constraint object/struct and not function name.
* Function class constructor takes function name for convenience.
* Constraint class constructor takes constraint name for convenience.
* CustomFunction class for creating functions written in python that work with the C library.
* CustomConstraint class for creating constraints written in python that work with the C library.
* Changed constraint (file) names PF and BOUND to ACPF and NBOUND, respectively.
* Separated netowrk and parser.
* (Generic) Parser class constructor takes file extension or sample filename for convenience.
* Format-specific parsers for mat,raw,art files also available (ParserMAT,ParserRAW,ParserART).
* CustomParser class for creating parsers written in python that work with the C library.
* Raw parser availability is detected when library is placed in pfnet/lib folder (no environment variable needed anymore).

Version 1.2.8
-------------
* Python-based parsers.
* Info dictionary in Python wrapper that indictes availability of graphviz, python-based parser, raw parser.
* Autotools build system (automatic detection of raw_parser, graphviz, python-based parser).
* Travis continuous integration.
* Readthedocs-based documentation.
* Fixed mpc2mat and parser_MAT gen cost ordering.

Version 1.2.7
-------------
* Added constraint that enforces AC branch flow limits using current magnitudes (ignores branches with 0 ratingA).
* Added support for extra variables in constraints (Jbar, Gbar matrices) and in problem.
* Changed constraint nnz counters (Acounter,Jcounter,Gcounter) to (A_nnz,J_nnz,G_nnz).
* Changed constraint row counters (Aconstr_index,Jcounstr_index,Gconstr_index) to (A_row,J_row,G_row).
* Made constraint that enforces DC branch flow limits ignore branches with 0 ratingA.

Version 1.2.6
-------------
* Branch bus name changes (from/to to k/m).
* Branch AC flow getters.
